prompt_template = f"""Parse a navigation instruction delimited by triple quotes and your task is to perform the following actions:
1. Extract Destination: Understand the entire instruction and summarize a description of the destination. The description should be a sentence containing landmark and roomtype. The description of the destination should not accurately describe the orientation and order. Here are examples about destination: "second room on the left" -> "room"(neglect order and direction); "between the bottom of the first stair and the console table in the entry way" -> "console table near entry way"(simplify description); "in front of the railing about halfway between the two upstairs rooms" -> "railing near two upstair rooms";
2. Split instructions: Split the instruction into a series of sub-instructions according to the execution steps. Each sub-instruction contain one landmark.
3. Infer agent's state constraints: Infer the state constraints that the agent should satisfy for each sub-instruction. There're thee constraint types: location constraints, diretion constraints, object constraints. You need to select an appropriate constraint type and give the corresponding constraint object. Direction constraint object has two types: left, right. Constraints can format as a tuple: (constraint type, constraint object)
4. Make a decision: Analyze the landmarks, actions, and directions in each sub-instruction to determine how the agent should act. For a landmark, the agent has three options: approach, move away, or approach and then move away. For direction, the agent has three options: turn left, turn right, or go forward
Provide your answer in JSON format with the following details:
1. use the following keys: destination, sub-instructions, state-constraints, decisions
2. the value of destination is a string
3. the value of sub-instructions is a list of all sub-instructions
4. the value of state-constraints is a JSON. The key is index start from zero and the value is a list of all constraints, each constraint is a tuple
5. the value of decisions is a nested JSON. The first level JSON's key is index start from zero and it;s value is second level JONS with keys: landmarks, directions. The value of landmarks is a list of tuples, each tuple contains (landmark, action). The value of directions is a list of direction choice for each sub-instruction.
An Example:
User: "Walk into the living room and keep walking straight past the living room. Then walk into the entrance under the balcony. Wait in the entrance to the other room."
You: {{"destination": "entrance to the other room under the balcony", "sub-instructions": ["Walk into the living room", "keep walking straight past the living room", "walk into the entrance under the balcony", "wait in the entrance to the other room"], "state-constraints": {{"0": [["location constraint", "living room"]], "1": [["location constraint", "living room"]], "2": [["location constraint", "balcony"], ["object constraint", "entrance"]], "3": [["location constraint", "other room"], ["object constraint", "entrance"]]}}, "decisions": {{"0": {{"landmarks": [["living room", "approach"]], "directions": ["forward"]}}, "1": {{"landmarks": [["living room", "move away"]], "directions": ["forward"]}}, "2": {{"landmarks": [["balcony", "approach"], ["entrance", "approach"]], "directions": ["forward"]}}, "3": {{"landmarks": [["other room", "approach"], ["entrance", "approach"]], "directions": ["forward"]}}}}}}
ATTENTION:
1. constraint type: location constraint is for room type, object constraint is for object type, directions constraint. Don't confuse object constriant with location constraint!
2. landmark choice: approach, move away, approach then move away
3. direction choice: left, right, forward
4. The landmark and constraint object should not accurately describe the orientation and order. Here arre examples about landmark: "second step from the top" -> "step"(neglect order and position relation); "room directly ahead" -> "room"; "right bedroom door" -> "bedroom door"
